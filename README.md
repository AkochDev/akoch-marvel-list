# akoch-marvel-list
Simple app with Clean Architecture, MVVM, Jetpack Compose, Hilt DI and Room local DB.
To compile this application you must use the lattest version of the Android Studio IDE (Artic Fox or newer).
Not sure why but some of the composable unit tests fail when the test file is executed as a whole, but pass when the test is run individually, need to check this...

Please don't abuse of the Marvel API keys, we are limited to 3k daily requests.

Enjoy
